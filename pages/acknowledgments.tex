I would like to express my sincere thanks to my advisor, Prof.\ Thomas Eibert, for his help and advice. 
I am grateful for his support and for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project.
I would also like to thank my supervisor, Mr.\ Han Na, for his guidance and support throughout the course of this thesis. 
I am grateful for his patience, encouragement, and valuable feedback.
His framework for using the optix ray tracing engine was very helpful and made the implementation of the algorithm much easier.
