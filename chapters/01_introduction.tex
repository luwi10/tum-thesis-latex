\section{Applications of Microwave Imaging}
Finding information about an area of interest by measuring certain physical properties from this area at one or more places is a fundamental problem.
After all, the human senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste) are all measurements of the environment to recreate a model of the world around us.
Usually the processed information is visualized in a way that is easy to understand for humans, these algorithms are called imaging algorithms.
In Electro-Magnetic-Field (EMF) imaging, the goal is to reconstruct the properties of an object from measurements of the scattered electromagnetic field.
This problem is called the inverse-scattering problem.
In some sense our eyes are also an EMF imaging system, as they measure the light  which is scattered by the surrounding objects it hits.
The applications of EMF-imaging reach from medical imaging (MRI, CT) to security (metal detectors, X-ray scanners) and geophysics (seismic imaging, ground-penetrating radar).
They vary mostly in the frequency of the EMF used, as this determines the penetration depth and the resolution of the imaging system.
The higher the frequency, the higher the resolution, but the lower the penetration depth.
This thesis focusses on waves in the microwave frequency range (around 300 MHz to 300 GHz) which corresponds to a wavelength of 1m to 1mm.
Waves of this wavelength will result in a scattering effect when hitting an object of similar size, so they are well suited for practical applications~\parencite{pastorino_microwave_2018}.
Microwave imaging is used in medical applications (breast cancer detection, brain imaging)~\parencite{wang_medical_2014}, security (contraband detection, people screening)~\parencite{ahmed_microwave_2021} and civil engineering (crack detection, subsurface inspection)~\parencite{pastorino_microwave_2018}.

\section{The Principle behind Time-Reversal Imaging}
The term `time-reversal' sounds like a magic concept.
Most think of it as some way to stop the aging-process or even revert it.
In the context of imaging, time-reversal is rather about finding the cause of present measurements in the past.
This is further explained at the example of three kids (A, B and C) playing catch with a ball.
Make a video of kid A throwing the ball to kid B and then revert the video.
The video will then show, how the Ball flies from kid B to kid A and anyone who only saw the reverted video could conclude that it must have been kid A who threw the ball and not kid C.
This problem is trivial if a video of the whole setup and the whole process of throwing and catching the ball is available.
Now suppose, that the video only shows how kid B caught the ball.
Simply time-reverting this video will not reveal who threw the ball in the first place.
But if kid B would exactly replicate the movement in the time-reversed video it would throw the ball back where it came from so it would land at kid A.
This is the principle behind any time-reversal imaging algorithm.
It's application to microwave imaging is a little bit more complex, as the field doesn't propagate in a straight line like the ball, but as a wave.
It shows one of the main flaws of time-reversal imaging, namely that for it to work it is necessary to measure the whole impact of the source.
In case of the player throwing a ball this was easy, as the whole impact is bound to the ball.
A wave on the other hand will propagate in all directions, so there would have to be measurements all around the setting.
The following schematic shows how a receiver array around the source approximately creates a time-reversed version of the expanding wave that will contract at the source location.
If there were infinitely many receivers around the source, they would create a perfect time-reversed wave.
