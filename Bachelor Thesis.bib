Under the Born approximation, the point spread functions ({PSFs}) for {TR} and {BP} are ﬁrst derived and then used to compare their imaging resolutions.

	abstract = {We clariﬁed the theoretical relationship between the back-projection ({BP}) imaging and classical linear inverse solutions via the hybrid back-projection ({HBP}) imaging. In the {HBP} imaging, which is mathematically similar to the time-reversal source imaging, cross correlations of observed waveforms with the corresponding Green’s functions are calculated. The key condition for {BP} to work well is that the Green’s function is sufﬁciently close to the delta function. Then, the {BP} image represents the slip motion on a fault, and approximately equals to the least-squares solution ({LSS}). In {HBP}, instead of the Green’s function in {BP}, the stacked autocorrelation function of the Green’s function must be close to the delta function to obtain a ﬁne image. Because the autocorrelation function is usually closer to the delta function than the original function, we can expect that {HBP} works better than {BP}, if we can reasonably estimate the Green’s function. With additional condition that the stacked cross-correlation function of the Green’s functions for different source locations is small enough, the {HBP} image is also approximately equal to the {LSS}. If these assumptions are not satisﬁed, however, the {HBP} image corresponds to a damped {LSS} with an extremely large damping parameter, which is clearly inferior to usual inverse solutions. On the other hand, the advantages of the {BP} method are much less computation and no necessity of Green’s functions.},

	abstract = {To overcome the multipath interference in locating transient electromagnetic ({EM}) radiation sources in an indoor environment, we propose a criterion that calculates the correlation between back-propagated signals from observation points, to be used in {EM} time reversal ({EMTR}) algorithms. The method introduced in this article has three main advantages with respect to classical methods that use full-wave simulations and other criteria, such as maximum ﬁeld strength. First, compared with full-wave techniques in the back-propagation phase, the proposed correlation-based method utilizes approximated transfer functions from the ray-tracing technique, which can improve the computation efﬁciency. Second, an inverted-loss model is used for the back-propagation, which could reduce the localization error caused by multipath effects due to signal attenuation and time delay. Third, the proposed correlation criterion has weak correlation with the source characteristics, which makes it applicable to the localization in indoor reﬂective environments with only two observation points. Several numerical simulations are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed correlation-based {EMTR} technique is able to locate radiation sources accurately and efﬁciently in indoor reﬂective environments.},

	abstract = {A plethora of papers can be found in the scientiﬁc literature talking about time reversal. The term time reversal exists in the publications in a variety of different ﬁelds, such as ultrasonics, acoustics, wireless communications, electromagnetics, antennas and propagation, optics, physics, and philosophy. The term time reversal by itself sounds very interesting, and can provide many interpretations that are fascinating. However, due to a loose use of this term, it may in many cases lead to fallacious interpretations and conclusions if it is not interpreted in strict scientiﬁc terms. The main goal of this paper is to explain the appropriate deﬁnition of the term time reversal in electrical engineering in general, and in electromagnetics for wireless communications, to be speciﬁc. However, the motivation of the work presented in this paper is not to raise a controversy about time reversal and its related research. Rather, the aim of this work is to highlight the basic electricalengineering fundamentals that are necessary to study time reversal and to correctly deﬁne it, and to then accordingly interpret the results. Hence, the true and fallacious beneﬁts of electromagnetic time reversal will be exposed. To serve this purpose, the paper is divided into two parts. First, a detailed literature review is presented. The true history of the term time reversal in electrical engineering is traced. In this part, most of the reported deﬁnitions of time reversal and its claimed capabilities are summarized. Some problems with the application of time reversal in electromagnetics are discussed, both theoretically and practically. All of the time-reversal papers talk about reciprocal networks, so the fact of the non-reciprocity of a single-antenna system in the time domain (the way we generally interpret it) is presented, to prove theoretically that there is a problem with how we interpret time reversal in electromagnetics. Finally, practical examples are shown, where time reversal is used in a wireless system and in an acoustic de-reverberation problem. The exact capabilities of time reversal in electrical engineering are exposed in those experiments.},

To predict the time reversal focusing on antenna arrays, a formalism that involves impedance matrix is developed. We show that antenna coupling can dramatically modify the focal spot. Especially, we observe, that in some circumstances, sub-wavelength focusing on a bi-dimensional array may arise.},

	abstract = {Time reversal of ultrasonic fields represents a way to focus through an inhomogeneous medium. This may be acomplished by a time-reversal mirror ("Mm)ade from an array of transmit-receive transducersthat respond linearly and allow the incident acoustic pressure to be sampled. The pressure fieldis then time-reversed and re-emitted. This process can be used to focus through inhomogeneous media ona reflective target that behaves as an acoustic source after being insonified. The time-reversal approach is introduced in a discussion of the classical techniques used for focusing pulsed waves through inhomogeneous media (adaptative time-delay techniques). Pulsed wave time-reversal focusing is shown using reciprocity valid in inhomogeneous medium to be optimal in the sense that it realizes the spatial-temporalmatched filter to the inhomogeneous propagation transfer function between the array and the target. Time-reversal focusing technique provides the optimal inputs to the transducer elements by maximizing the pressure at the target location. The research on time-reversed wave fields has also led tothe development ofnew concepts thatare described in the paper: time-reversal cavity that extends the concept of the {TRM}; iterative time-reversal processing for automatic sorting of targets according to their reflectivity and resonating of extended targets. In thelast part of the paper thefundamental differences between a {TRM} and a phase-conjugated mirror are described.},

This link helps to clarify how we can learn about the symmetries of our world; how to understand the relationship between symmetries and what is real, and how to overcome pervasive illusions about the direction of time. Roberts explains the significance of time reversal in a way that intertwines physics and philosophy, to establish what the arrow of time means and how we can come to know it.
